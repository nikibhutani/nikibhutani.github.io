								<h2>The Road Not Taken</h2>
								<p style='color: #8AA1DA; font-style: italic; text-align: center'> Two roads diverged in a yellow wood, </br>
									And sorry I could not travel both </br>
									And be one traveler, long I stood </br>
									And looked down one as far as I could </br>
									To where it bent in the undergrowth; </br> </br>

									Then took the other, as just as fair, </br>
									And having perhaps the better claim, </br>
									Because it was grassy and wanted wear; </br> </br>

									.... </br>
									 -  Robert Frost
								</p>
								<p> I still find it awkward to tell people that before I joined the PhD in Computer Sciences program, I did my bachelors in Textile Technology. 
									I suppose it is a road nobody takes. 
									Well, it is taken now. 
									My foot print is all over that road; sometimes walking, sometimes limping, sometimes sprinting.
								</p>
								<p> The stigma is particularly strong in India (where I come from) where most people are like horses with blinkers on. 
									No offense. 
									May be some. 
									I find it incredible that people find it incredible that one can study computer science after studying textile technology. 
									I am living proof that you can do whatever you want, whenever you want. 
									Except for illegal stuff; don't do that.
								</p>
								
								<p><a href='http://textile.iitd.ac.in' target="_blank">Textile Technology</a> is a engineering program and not a arts class, by the way. </p>
								<p>Life has been a meandering road for me and I loved every turn and twist in that roller coaster ride. 
									In this journey I met some really creative, talented, geeky people; I know I am not as creative or talented or geeky as the best of them. 
									But I tend to bite off more than I can chew and my faith in myself sees me through to the end. 
									I finish what I start.

								<h2>On Your Marks, Get Set, ... RUN!</h2>
								<p> People who know me now accuse me of being a fitness freak. 
								But few know how I was once a sloth and how I came to love running.

								</p>
								<p> I think I owe it to my PhD course. 
								Like a typical (it is typical, right? yes?) research, findings were plateauing, papers were getting rejected and the researcher, yours truly, was going crazy. 
								Work was not leading anywhere. 
								So I decided to look for something that is not open ended or vague; 
								something that does not require literature study; 
								something that will not get rejected in spite of results because it was not novel or academic enough. 
								</p>
								<p>Well, whats more well defined than 13 miles and 192.5 yards. 
								I mean, just look at those precise numbers! 
								I don't need a survey to study all the previous runs. 
								The average long distance runner aims to run that distance in 2 hours. 
								If I can do it, can anybody reject my result? Can I do it?

								<h2>The Bug, The Bake And The Bean</h2>
								<p>When I am not busy working or working out, I am busy looking at the world map and checking off places I have been to and looking at the long list of places to be at. 
								I always deny it. I don't think I travel extensively. I am only trying to figure out if I love forests more than beaches, sunrises more than sunsets, valleys more than mountains. 
								May be it is true what they say: I have been bitten by the travel bug.

								<p>And when the airlines won't have me, I have my oven. 
								I dream of opening a bakery someday. 
								My earl grey cake is simply amazing. 
								If you won't believe me, read the following reviews:
								</p>
								<p style='color: #7BBCAC; font-style: italic;'>
								<span style='display: inline-block;vertical-align: middle;'>
								"I hate(d) tea, but that tea cake was absolutely scrumptious." - Pallavi </br>
								"Oh you want me to get fat. Do you not need company at the marathon?" - Ankita </br> 
								"Can I join your bakery too? But don't expect me to do any work!" - JD </br> 
								</span>
								<span class="image block_image" style='margin: 0 2em;'><img src='images/earl_grey.png' style='width: 20em; max-width: 80%; display: inline-block; vertical-align: middle;'/></span>
								
								</p>
								
								</p>
								<p>I think the cake goes well with a good cup of coffee. 
								Did I mention I love coffee?</p>
